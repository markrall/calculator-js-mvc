# Calculator JS MVC

An MVC JS calculator built on ES6, SASS, Parcel and TypeScript that emulates the Mac OS X system calculator in style and (some) function.

üíÅ The point of the project was to:

- Build something using vanilla JS using the MVC pattern,
- Take the [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) web app bundler for a spin,
- Start learning [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) handson.

üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap:

[ ] Refactor calculatorView to make event handling modular
[ ] Add keyboeard support
